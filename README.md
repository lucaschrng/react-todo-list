# React TODO List
This is a simple TODO list app built with React. You can add, delete and search for tasks. You also have the ability to 
create an important task that will always appear on top of the list. For the search functionality, I used Fuse.js to
allow fuzzy searching. To store the tasks, I used localStorage and the Context API.
